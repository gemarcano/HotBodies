Architecture

Layered, 3 layer

View <--> Control/Logic <--> Data Access

For the Control/Logic layer, Client to Server pattern. Server supplies tasks, offloads to clients.
  If Data is a network resource, data Access can also be delegated to the Client.

What about for distributed support?
Separation of tasks is necessary.


Some patterns to consider:
Strategy pattern
pimpl idom (Bridge pattern for portability (this may be overkill))
Facade maybe between layers?
