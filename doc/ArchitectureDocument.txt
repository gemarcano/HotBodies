Architecture

Layered, 3 layer

View <--> Control/Logic <--> Data Access

Threading can be handled within the Control/Logic layer. View will be on its own thread. Data access serves solely as something to translate data to its internal representation, so it should be made thread safe.

Some patterns to consider:
Strategy pattern
pimpl idom (Bridge pattern for portability (this may be overkill))
Facade maybe between layers?
